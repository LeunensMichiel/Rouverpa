# Rose Garden brightens your day

> "Very sympathetic and helpful owner!", "Very friendly", "Quality flowers!".

These are some Google reviews of flower shop [Rose Garden](https://www.rose-garden.be "Rose Garden").
**Rose Garden** has been a customer of Rouverpa for many years. The flourishing flower shop is located in **Pittem** on the market.

All spotlights are focused on the always smiling **Isabel Dobbels**, the owner of Rose garden.
She opens her doors every day with a lot of passion and pride. She works with a lot of love for the flowers.

A customer in the spotlight at **Rouverpa verpakkingen**!

Isabel Dobbels is married to Kurt Van Walleghem. The business was founded **53 years ago** by her parents-in-laws
in an old mansion in Pittem. The shop was systematically expanded. Since 1998 the business has been taken over by
Isabel and her husband. Isabel is in charge of the **flower business** and her husband continues what his father has always done, namely **growing the cut flowers**. In the meantime, son **Matice** also helps in the nursery.

Feel free to watch the video in dutch or read on.

The nursery's main crop is the **astronomia** flower. They grow **14 colors**. Usually the flower
used in a mixed bouquet, but it can also be used alone. The flower is very durable, special
and decorative.

In addition, they also grow **30 different types of tulips**. Tulip cultivation takes place from January to April.
They cut their fresh tulips every day. The tulips are both sold in the store, but also delivered to the auction in
Brussels. Kurt always goes to Brussels before dawn to deliver the flowers.

They still find the experience in their physical store most important.
It is pleasant for the customers to smell the scent of the fresh flowers. But in addition to their **physical store**, they also have a **website with webshop**. This is increasingly becoming an important medium in the flower sector. People like to look in advance at the assortment of flowers.

A very important part of the bouquet is both making the bouquet with beautiful
flowers, as well as the **packaging** around the bouquet. When people ask Isabel to make a bouquet or a flower arrangement
of course, she does so with great care. She likes to make her job to wrap the flower nicely for
the customers. She cannot actually give any of the flowers unpackaged.

She often uses the **kraft** and **colored foil**. The kraft comes in different types with or without motif
and the colored foil comes in different colors. This way she can actually adapt the color **to the color
of the flowers**, Isabel likes to be creative with that. In addition, they also use the **transparent foil**.
And to finish the bouquet completely, they decorate it with a **dekoraphia** ribbon around the packaging.

How did they end up at Rouverpa?
Isabel's parents-in-law were already a customer of Rouverpa. In fact, from day 1 that Rouverpa did the job,
Geert ended up with my mother-in-law. When they took over the business, they decided to continue working with
Rouverpa. **“When you're happy, you let people come back.”**, says Isabel Dobbels. A nice collaboration,
family bond with a chat makes the collaboration so good. Rose Garden now operates **for over 30 years**
together with Rouverpa.

We at Rouverpa wish Isabel and her husband the best for the future. We admire the passion and pride.
